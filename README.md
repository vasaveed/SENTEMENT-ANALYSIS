description:
During my internship, I designed and implemented a complete end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline in Python to categorize short customer feedback as positive or negative. This project aimed to automate sentiment labeling and provide data-driven insights for product and service improvement
Data Collection & Preparation
Constructed a labeled dataset of 20 sample statements, evenly balanced for positive/negative sentiment.
Developed a robust clean_text() function that:
Converts text to lowercase.
Strips URLs, punctuation, and numeric noise.
Tokenizes using NLTK and removes stopwords.
Applies lemmatization for normalization
Impact & Learnings:
Delivered a fully functional sentiment classification model with clear evaluation and visualization of performance.
Gained hands-on experience in NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, model training, and result interpretation.
Enhanced skills in exploratory data analysis through visualizations like word clouds and confusion matrix heatmaps.
Learned how to balance model training with class_weight and deploy best practices for stratified data splitting.
